The Set, Map, and WeakMap are built-in data structures in JavaScript for storing collections of values. They offer various benefits and use cases:

Set: A Set is a collection of unique values, allowing you to efficiently check if an item exists in the set or add new items. You can create a Set using the Set constructor:

vbnet

const set = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
Map: A Map is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a unique value. You can create a Map using the Map constructor:

c#

const map = new Map([
  [1, "one"],
  [2, "two"],
  [3, "three"]
]);

WeakMap: A WeakMap is similar to a Map, but with some important differences. Unlike a Map, a WeakMap only allows objects to be used as keys and does not prevent the keys from being garbage collected. You can create a WeakMap using the WeakMap constructor:

javascript

const weakMap = new WeakMap();
const object1 = {};
weakMap.set(object1, "value1");

In summary, these data structures are used for different purposes depending on the specific needs of the application, but they all offer an efficient way of storing and manipulating collections of values in JavaScript.
